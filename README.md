# Audio Engine — Work In Progress

## What this is

I'm trying to build a small audio processing engine while learning Rust and learning about audio processing at the same time. This repository is a learning project — I don't know much Rust yet and I'm still figuring out audio concepts, so please don't expect polished or idiomatic code.

## Expectations & caveats

- This is an experimental learning repo. Code quality, API design, error handling, and performance are likely rough.
- I may use quick hacks and unsafe shortcuts to get things working while I learn.
- If you're here for production-ready audio code, this isn't it.
